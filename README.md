It is a simple chatting application that works over bluetooth 
For now it is currently limited to 2 person only one have have to act as a server and second one have to act as a client
I have used jetpack compose of user interface part and rest of the logic with kotlin

For now it does not store any kind of data as you leave the connection all the chats are lost 

In future I have decided to shift to BLE(bluetooth low energy)that would save power
and decided to some basic feature of chatting appliction.
